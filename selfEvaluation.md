# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

9/10

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

these concepts can be very hard to grasp at first
Having a partner to work with and ask question to is greatly helpful
it felt fine, only due to me previous experience otherwise i would have been quite overwhelmed to say the least
productive struggle was good today
not much unproductive struggle compared to yesterday

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

more complicated looping questions
do all the practice examples
yes!

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Questions are minimal now but i imagine my questions would be astronomical if i were seeing these concepts for the first time
